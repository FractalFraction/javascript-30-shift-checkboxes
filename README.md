# javascript-30-shift-checkboxes

Objective 

Plan 
- Create inputs and labels
- Style inputs and labels
- Strikethrough label when checkbox is clicked
- If user presses Shift Key, enable multiple checkboxes to be selected and labels to be strikedthrough

Reflections
- Got more comfortable working with the DOM
- Refactoring the callback functions earlier would have been better for readability
- Git commiting messages were short, not detailed for other programmers
- Overall happy with the end result!

Next Steps
- Add functionality that allows the user to deselect multiple checkboxes
